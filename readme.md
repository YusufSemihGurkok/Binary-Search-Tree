Binary Tree Operations
This repository contains C++ code that demonstrates various operations on a binary tree, such as insertion, deletion, and different methods of tree traversal (inorder, preorder, and postorder).

Usage
After running the program, you will be presented with a menu where you can choose different operations to perform on the binary tree:

Insert: Insert a new key into the binary tree.
Delete: Remove a key from the binary tree.
Inorder Print: Print the keys of the binary tree in inorder traversal.
Preorder Print: Print the keys of the binary tree in preorder traversal.
Postorder Print: Print the keys of the binary tree in postorder traversal.
Exit: Quit the program.
Follow the prompts on the screen to input your choices and interact with the binary tree.
